# MyReads Project

This as a project as part of Google Web Developer Scholarshiw with Udacity Nanodegree. Provided requirements and a static website starter code a bookkeeping app was created. Search books and add them to your reading shelves.

### To run project

* Download or clone repo
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
